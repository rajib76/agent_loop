# Agent Loop > Agent Orchestration

## TL;DR

We are building multi-agent orchestration systems because we cannot unlearn the way humans organize work. Humans need orchestration because each human is a narrowly specialized cognitive unit. Agents are not. An agent is an LLM plus a scaffold, and the scaffold is the thing we should be investing in — not the org chart around it. In most cases, **a single well-scaffolded agent in a tight loop will beat a graph of specialist agents passing messages**. Orchestration should be the exception, not the default.

## The category error

The implicit assumption behind agent orchestration is:

> "If you needed N humans to do this job, you need N agents to do this job."

This is a category error. It treats "agent" as a synonym for "human worker," and then borrows the entire apparatus of human team design — roles, handoffs, managers, RACI, escalation paths — and applies it to a substrate where most of those constructs are not load-bearing.

Humans need org charts because:

- A single human cannot hold expert-level competence in tax law, kubernetes, copywriting, and contract negotiation.
- A single human has a fixed working-memory budget and gets tired.
- Communication is the cheapest way humans share context, even though it is lossy.
- Specialization is how a society scales individual cognitive limits.

None of these constraints are intrinsic to an LLM-based agent. They are intrinsic to *people*.

## What an agent actually is

An agent is not a "specialist." An agent is:

```
agent  =  LLM  +  scaffold
scaffold  =  tools  +  context  +  memory  +  process knowledge  +  loop
```

The LLM is fungible, general-purpose cognition. The scaffold is what makes it good at a job. If you change the scaffold, you get a different "specialist" without changing the underlying engine. Specialization in agent-land is a property of *context*, not a property of *the worker*.

This is the part that breaks the human analogy. A human cannot become a tax lawyer at 9am and a kernel engineer at 10am. An agent can — you just swap the scaffold. The cost of "becoming a different specialist" is approximately the cost of loading a different prompt, a different toolset, and a different memory store.

So the question shifts. The question is not "how do I coordinate ten specialists?" The question is "how do I build one loop that loads the right scaffold at the right time?"

## Why orchestration is seductive

Orchestration feels right because:

1. It maps onto how we already build software (services, queues, DAGs, workflow engines).
2. It maps onto how we already build organizations (roles, handoffs, reviews).
3. It is *legible* — you can draw it on a whiteboard, and a manager can understand it.
4. It gives the illusion of reliability through decomposition.

None of these are evidence that it is the right architecture for agents. They are evidence that it is the architecture we already know how to draw.

## Why the loop usually wins

A single agent in a loop has structural advantages over an orchestrated graph:

- **No lossy handoffs.** Every inter-agent message is a context bottleneck. The receiving agent sees a summary, not the raw evidence. The loop preserves the full trajectory.
- **No coordination overhead.** Multi-agent systems spend tokens negotiating who does what, re-explaining state, and reconciling disagreements. The loop spends those tokens on the actual problem.
- **Adaptive specialization.** The loop can pull in the right tool, retrieve the right doc, or load the right sub-prompt at the moment it is needed. It is JIT specialization, not pre-allocated specialization.
- **One thing to debug.** When it fails, you read one trace. When an orchestrated system fails, you read N traces and the message bus between them.
- **Cheaper to evolve.** Improving the scaffold improves all "specialties" at once. Improving an orchestrator improves nothing about the agents inside it.

Orchestration introduces real costs (coordination, handoff loss, surface area) in exchange for benefits (parallelism, isolation, role clarity) that are mostly only valuable when the substrate is humans.

## When orchestration is actually warranted

Not never. Reasonable cases:

- **True parallelism over independent subtasks** — e.g. fanning out 200 document reviews. This is map-reduce, not orchestration in the interesting sense.
- **Hard isolation requirements** — security boundaries, separate credentials, separate data domains.
- **Heterogeneous substrates** — one node is an LLM, another is a deterministic solver, another is a human-in-the-loop.
- **Latency/cost tiering** — a small fast model triages, a large slow model handles the residual.

The pattern: orchestrate when the boundary is a *real* boundary (security, hardware, modality, parallel work), not when the boundary is just "a different kind of expertise."

## The real lever: scaffold the process, not the team

The thing we keep externalizing into orchestration — "the manager agent decides who handles this" — is process knowledge. Process knowledge is just another kind of context. It can live inside the loop:

- as a playbook the agent reads,
- as a state machine the agent advances,
- as a checklist the agent verifies against,
- as a set of sub-prompts/tools the agent invokes when the situation calls for them.

Putting the process *inside* the agent's scaffold, instead of *between* multiple agents, keeps the full trajectory in one place and makes the system one thing rather than N things.

This reframes the design problem:

| Orchestration mindset            | Loop mindset                                  |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Who are the agents?              | What does the loop need to know?              |
| How do they hand off?            | What tools should be reachable from the loop? |
| Who is the manager?              | What does the playbook look like?             |
| How do we resolve disagreements? | How does the loop self-check?                 |
| How many agents?                 | How rich is the scaffold?                     |

## A sharper claim

Most "multi-agent systems" today are LARPing as organizations. They are reproducing the *symptoms* of human cognitive limits in a substrate that does not have those limits. The symptoms cost tokens, latency, and reliability, and buy very little.

The default architecture should be: **one agent, one loop, rich scaffold.** Reach for orchestration when there is a real boundary that justifies it — not because the problem looks like it would need a team if humans were doing it.

## Open questions

- How far does a single loop scale before scaffolding complexity itself becomes the bottleneck?
- Is there a clean formalism for "process-as-scaffold" — something more rigorous than "put it in the prompt"?
- What does evaluation look like when the same loop plays many roles? Per-role evals, or end-to-end task evals?
- When orchestration *is* warranted, what is the minimum-viable orchestration (vs. the maximalist multi-agent framework default)?
